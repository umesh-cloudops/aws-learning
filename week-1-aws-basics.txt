🧠 1. What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing means using the internet to store data, run applications, and access servers instead of using your own computer or data center.
It helps save money because you only pay for what you use, and you don’t have to buy big machines to run your apps.

☁️ 2. Why is AWS the Market Leader?

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the biggest and most trusted cloud platform in the world.
It gives many services like servers, storage, databases, and tools for developers.
AWS is known for being fast, secure, and affordable, and it’s used by many big companies like Netflix, Airbnb, and Amazon itself.

💻 3. What is Compute (EC2)?

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) gives you virtual computers in the cloud.
You can use these to run websites, apps, or software without having a physical computer.
You can start, stop, or delete these servers anytime and only pay for the time you use them.

📦 4. What is Storage (S3)?

S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a place to store your files and data safely online.
You can keep anything — photos, videos, backups, or code files.
It’s secure, fast, and you can access your data from anywhere in the world.

🔑 5. What is IAM (Identity and Access Management)?

IAM helps you control who can use your AWS account and what they can do.
You can create users, groups, and give them only the permissions they need.
This keeps your account safe and prevents accidental or wrong changes.

👤 6. Difference Between Root User and IAM User

The Root User is the main owner of the AWS account. It has full access to everything.
You should use it only for billing or setup.

IAM Users are created under the root account. They have limited access and are used for daily work.
This is safer because if one user makes a mistake, it won’t affect the whole account.

## 🔑 IAM Setup Steps
1. Logged into AWS Console using the **root account**
2. Opened the **IAM (Identity & Access Management)** service
3. Created a new **IAM User** named `devops-user`
4. Gave it **AdministratorAccess** (for learning purpose only)
5. Enabled **AWS Management Console access** for the user
6. Created a **custom password** and noted it securely
7. Signed out of the root account and logged in with the new IAM user
8. Created an **Access Key** for CLI use (downloaded `.csv` file)
9. Installed **AWS CLI** on my local system
10. Configured the CLI using:
   ```bash
   aws configure

🔒 7. How Do Permissions and Security Work in AWS?

Permissions in AWS are given using policies.
A policy tells AWS what a user is allowed or not allowed to do.
For example, a user can get permission only to use S3 or EC2.
AWS always follows the rule of least privilege — give users only the access they really need.


## 🏁 Summary
This week helped me understand how AWS works and why security is important.  
Next step — start my first EC2 server and deploy a small app! 🚀
