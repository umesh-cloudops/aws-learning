Week 2 – EC2 Basics, Linux Commands & Security Groups 🚀
🧠 What I Learned

What EC2 is and why it's used

How to launch and connect to an EC2 instance

Basic Linux commands (very important in DevOps)

What Security Groups are and how they control traffic

How to install software on EC2

💻 1. What is EC2?

EC2 is a virtual machine in the cloud.
You can choose CPU, RAM, storage, OS, and pay only for what you use.

Good for: apps, websites, automation scripts, learning Linux.

🚀 2. Launching an EC2 Instance

Open EC2 Dashboard

Click Launch Instance

Choose Amazon Linux or Ubuntu

Select t2.micro (free tier)

Create/select an SSH key pair

Set Security Group → allow SSH (22)

Launch and wait for Running status

🔌 3. Connecting to EC2 (SSH)

Linux/Mac:

chmod 400 mykey.pem
ssh -i "mykey.pem" ec2-user@PUBLIC_IP


Ubuntu:

ssh -i "mykey.pem" ubuntu@PUBLIC_IP

🐧 4. Linux Basics Learned
File & Directory:
ls
pwd
cd folder/
mkdir test
rm file.txt

File editing:
nano file.txt
cat file.txt

Updates:
sudo yum update -y   # Amazon Linux
sudo apt update -y   # Ubuntu

🔒 5. What Are Security Groups?

Security Groups act as firewalls.

Common inbound rules:

SSH → 22

HTTP → 80

HTTPS → 443

They control what traffic can enter your EC2 instance.

🔥 6. Installing Software (Example: Apache)

Amazon Linux:

sudo yum install httpd -y
sudo systemctl start httpd


Ubuntu:

sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo systemctl start apache2

🏁 Summary

This week I learned how to launch EC2, connect using SSH, run Linux commands, install software, and manage traffic using Security Groups.
