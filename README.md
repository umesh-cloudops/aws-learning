# 👋 Hi, I'm [UMESH KUMAR]  

🌩️ **Aspiring AWS DevOps Engineer** | 💻 Ex-ASP.NET Developer | 🌱 Learning Cloud, CI/CD & Automation

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a passionate learner transitioning from web development to the world of **Cloud and DevOps**.  
After gaining experience in **ASP.NET** and software development, I became deeply interested in how modern systems are built, deployed, and managed at scale.  

Now, I'm focused on understanding how to automate and optimize every step of the software delivery process using **AWS services** and **DevOps tools**.  

My goal is to grow into a skilled **AWS DevOps Engineer** who can design scalable, secure, and automated infrastructure to support reliable application delivery.
